**Maternity Care Access Analyzer**

The Maternity Care Access Analyzer is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to visualize geographic access to maternity care in the United States. By allowing users to input a radius and select a level of hospital care, the dashboard highlights areas lacking adequate access. Additionally, it provides insights into healthcare disparities by showing the percentage of women, across different races and poverty levels, who do not have sufficient maternity care access. This tool aims to support policymakers in identifying underserved regions and improving maternal care services.
